# Page Types
* Page Types are the types of pages found on websites and incorporated into a CMS. The following page types are used in NatSci websites:

## Homepage
* The Homepage design is unique from other pages - often allowing for marketing material and larger graphics. The Hero Image area is often used for the display of news articles but can be editorially selected to show static content as well. This page type often has many content areas within it.

## Section Front
* The Section is the landing page for an area of a site - these are often the pages linked from the primary (top) navigation bar. Generally speaking these have larger hero image areas than internal pages, but smaller than homepages. This page type can have one or two columns - second column would contain the secondary (side) navigation.

## Information Page
* The Information Page is the primary used page type - it is used for most all interior pages to display content and has a smaller hero image than the Section Front. This page type can have one or two columns - second column would contain the secondary (side) navigation.

## News Article
* Ths News Article is used for the posting of news. It contains a larger hero image than the Information Page. This page will display the release date and optional tags, article highlights and an audio player for MP3s.

## News Article Index
* The News Article Index is the index of news articles for a site. It contains a search bar, news by uit (if college site) and a listing of news articles. The page should contain a paging component at the bottom to traverse forward or backward in news articles.
